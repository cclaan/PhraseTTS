The most work is probably in the database end:
i was trying to make it so you could drag a new phrases.txt into itunes and it would
add any new phrases or delete removed phrases, but i didnt quite get there.


Updating the DB with a new file should preserve rowid's and keep the used_phrases table intact

im also not too happy with the SearchResult file, it kind of hides the fact that two tables are used to search,
which is good, but its a little sloppy sometimes. the methods to update an existing phrase, or insert a new one could 
be a little smoother. 


I took out the plus buttons because i didnt finish implementing them, and it seemed like
it would not be useful when the phrases are so large, 


I made a suggested words view that you can view by setting USE_WORD_LIST 0 to USE_WORD_LIST 1


we could implement a custom keyboard that has special keys:
 - go to beginning of phrase (helps to finish a phrase)
 - abcd layout 
 - hide keyboard, clear entire phrase



Volume could be louder
